# Pizza Sales Dashboard – Excel + MySQL

This project presents an Excel-based dashboard that analyzes pizza sales data. The raw data was queried using MySQL, exported to CSV, and visualized in Excel using PivotTables and charts.

---

## Project Overview

- Used MySQL to extract key performance metrics from a pizza sales dataset.
- Imported query results into Excel and built an interactive dashboard.
- Designed the layout, color scheme, and visuals independently.
- Created a dynamic experience with slicers, timelines, and the Excel Data Model.

## Key Metrics (KPIs)

- Total Revenue  
- Total Orders  
- Total Pizzas Sold

- **Bar Charts** – Top 5 and Bottom 5 Most Ordered Pizzas  
- **Funnel Chart** – Category Distribution (Classic, Veggie, Supreme, Chicken)  
- **Timeline Slicer** – Monthly and Quarterly filters connected to all visuals and KPIs

All visuals were created using PivotTables and connected through the Excel Data Model.

## Learning & Challenges

This project was inspired by the "Data Tutorials" YouTube channel, which uses Microsoft SQL. In contrast, I used MySQL, which introduced differences in query structure and import/export steps.  
While building the dashboard, I encountered slicer issues due to Data Model cache behavior and resolved them through manual troubleshooting. The dashboard layout, formatting, and structure were designed independently from scratch.
