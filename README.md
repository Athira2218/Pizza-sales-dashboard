# Pizza Sales Dashboard – Excel + MySQL

This project presents an Excel-based dashboard that analyzes pizza sales data. The raw data was queried using MySQL, exported to CSV, and visualized in Excel using PivotTables and charts.

---

## Project Overview

- Used MySQL to extract key performance metrics from a pizza sales dataset.
- Imported query results into Excel and built an interactive dashboard.
- Designed the layout, color scheme, and visuals independently.
- Created a dynamic experience with slicers, timelines, and the Excel Data Model.

## Key Metrics (KPIs)

- Total Revenue  
- Total Orders  
- Total Pizzas Sold  
- Average Order Value  
- Average Pizzas per Order

---

## Visualizations

- **Column Chart** – Orders by Day  
- **Line Chart** – Orders by Hour  
- **Pie Chart** – Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category  
- **Bar Charts** – Top 5 and Bottom 5 Most Ordered Pizzas  
- **Funnel Chart** – Category Distribution (Classic, Veggie, Supreme, Chicken)  
- **Timeline Slicer** – Monthly and Quarterly filters connected to all visuals and KPIs

All visuals were created using PivotTables and connected through the Excel Data Model.

## Learning & Challenges

This project was inspired by the "Data Tutorials" YouTube channel, which uses Microsoft SQL. In contrast, I used MySQL, which introduced differences in query structure and import/export steps.  
While building the dashboard, I encountered slicer issues due to Data Model cache behavior and resolved them through manual troubleshooting. The dashboard layout, formatting, and structure were designed independently from scratch.

## Acknowledgment

This project was inspired by the Data Tutorials YouTube channel. While the overall idea is based on their video, all SQL queries, design elements, layout decisions, and dashboard execution were done independently.
